# PasswordStrengthGUI
Password strength detection code with a GUI

The Password Strength Evaluator with GUI is an impressive Python project that showcases expertise in password security, hashing algorithms (SHA-256), and graphical user interface (GUI) development. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of cybersecurity concepts and the ability to create user-friendly applications.

The project focuses on evaluating the strength of passwords entered by users and providing detailed feedback on their security. It employs the industry-standard SHA-256 hashing algorithm to generate secure password hashes. The GUI interface adds a visually appealing and intuitive user experience, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

The application guides users to enter a password and confirm it, ensuring accuracy. Upon evaluation, the system analyzes the password's strength using various criteria, such as length, character types, and special characters. The feedback is displayed in real-time within the GUI, providing users with clear and concise information about their password's weaknesses or strengths.
